I don't know what market this German owned ""italian"" chain is aiming for but certainly not well travelled savvy Londoners.
The fresh pasta is...let down by the dreadful bland sauces.  When you order an arrabiata you don't think you have to tick to add extra chilli so it tastes of something.
When you order a bolognese sauce with the addition of ""Italian hard cheese"" (not parmesan) you don't expect there to be more cheese than sauce which made the dish inedible.  Wines not italian.  No service added so it is dreadful.  Very uncomfortable stool seating.More"

however this restaurant is completely ruined by the service. the system of going up and waiting for your food to be cooked doesn‚Äôt work in a group as you all are eating at different times. its extremely confusing and not explained properly by staff. they are extremely inattentive and unhelpful. we walked in and were greeted after a while by a woman who asked if we had been before then walked off without telling us where to sit or even saying we could choose a table. it was not explained where the different counters were and we were left to work it out ourselves.

I had a Crema di Funghi pasta and it was delicious! My mom had some pasta with king prawns and they didn't save on king prawns. She was very pleased! Worth the slightly high price. However, do not bother...sending chef notes with your order. My sister is breastfeeding her newborn and she can't have onions, pepper and spicy food. We added a note to the order and they completely ignored it. I didn't ask them to add chilli to her pasta but they added it anyway, along with onions and pepper. She ordered an Insalata Caprese as a starter for ¬£9.75. It was a very simple and small portion of salad. Based on the price, we were expecting something more sophisticated. I ordered Sprite and they sent me Sprite Zero. They told me they only have one Sprite, which is Sprite Zero from what I can see, nonetheless, they sell it as just Sprite. It goes for ¬£2.95 per small bottle, by the way. My pasta dish was worth the  price, and so was my mom's. Very tasty food. My sister tried to eat hers, but had to leave it there, unfortunately. She had to give her baby colic medication twice during the night. The restaurant has great potential, really good food, nice location, but they're failing on the details.More"

Upon arrival there was a big que that started...from outside and no social distancing was applied not even inside the permises. No greeting or explanation of how everything works was given. Unable to sit at a table before deciding what to eat, we were left to stand in a long que next to the bar. To kill some time we decided to order some drinks, but apparently you should have a Vapiano card to then be able to order, which no one provided us before hand. When we got to the station to order, food looked great, pasta is fresh and everything is cooked infront of you which makes the experience nice. When food was ready we sat down at a table and cutlery was nowhere to been seen, so again had to get up to ask for cutlery that was kept at the bar. Food was good and price was reasonable but the customer service side of the experience really put me off and didn't make me fully enjoy my food. It's a beautiful location and I would love to come back, I hope that with this feedback this company will  improve the organisation and managers will be more present to assure all customers leave happily.More"
