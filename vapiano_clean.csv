17-Apr-21,10,Tried to order takeaway pizza,"So, pretty empty, lots of staff, tried or order a takeaway pizza and directed to QR code sign to order.

It would not open link, stepped inside and was advised they could not take an order except through QR code.

PatheticMore"
9-Jan-21,40,Nice break for lunch!,"We stopped here for lunch after visiting the Tower Bridge. Not the best branch of Vapiano, but we weren't disappointed. Nice food and beverage. Fast service, nice decor and sittings. The place wasn't very busy during our visit, so we had a change to enjoy...the food and the break.More"
14-Oct-20,10,Very disappointing,"After the track and trace the very laborius on line ordering system which was made possible by the very helpful Victoria.  I don't know what market this German owned ""italian"" chain is aiming for but certainly not well travelled savvy Londoners.
The fresh pasta is...let down by the dreadful bland sauces.  When you order an arrabiata you don't think you have to tick to add extra chilli so it tastes of something.
When you order a bolognese sauce with the addition of ""Italian hard cheese"" (not parmesan) you don't expect there to be more cheese than sauce which made the dish inedible.  Wines not italian.  No service added so it is dreadful.  Very uncomfortable stool seating.More"
10-Oct-20,50,Good family night out ,"I love going to Vapiano with my two young children (toddler and infant). They have huge tables, plenty of space to park the buggy, and lots of clean/well designed baby high chairs. The staff are mostly young but show enthusiasm and want to help. When...our order took a particularly long time to arrive tonight we spoke to the manager Davide who was very apologetic and was very kind to personally get our orders delivered ASAP. He understood our frustration as our young daughter was hungry and cranky and continually checked up on us during our meal to make sure we were taken care of. We appreciated his efforts despite the initial tardiness of the food delivery (there was an internal technical error as they now have new guidelines in place due to covid). We will definitely be back.More"
5-Oct-20,30,"brilliant carbonara, awful service","visited here a couple of times and it is the best carbonara i‚Äôve ever tasted and the prices are extremely reasonable. the food is cooked in front of you so you can see it is all freshly cooked and you can adapt your food as...it‚Äôs being made. the portions are more than enough aswell. 

however this restaurant is completely ruined by the service. the system of going up and waiting for your food to be cooked doesn‚Äôt work in a group as you all are eating at different times. its extremely confusing and not explained properly by staff. they are extremely inattentive and unhelpful. we walked in and were greeted after a while by a woman who asked if we had been before then walked off without telling us where to sit or even saying we could choose a table. it was not explained where the different counters were and we were left to work it out ourselves. 

real let down when the food is so good.More"
28-Sep-20,20,Delicious food but no attention to detail,"The restaurant is really well located. I had a Crema di Funghi pasta and it was delicious! My mom had some pasta with king prawns and they didn't save on king prawns. She was very pleased! Worth the slightly high price. However, do not bother...sending chef notes with your order. My sister is breastfeeding her newborn and she can't have onions, pepper and spicy food. We added a note to the order and they completely ignored it. I didn't ask them to add chilli to her pasta but they added it anyway, along with onions and pepper. She ordered an Insalata Caprese as a starter for ¬£9.75. It was a very simple and small portion of salad. Based on the price, we were expecting something more sophisticated. I ordered Sprite and they sent me Sprite Zero. They told me they only have one Sprite, which is Sprite Zero from what I can see, nonetheless, they sell it as just Sprite. It goes for ¬£2.95 per small bottle, by the way. My pasta dish was worth the  price, and so was my mom's. Very tasty food. My sister tried to eat hers, but had to leave it there, unfortunately. She had to give her baby colic medication twice during the night. The restaurant has great potential, really good food, nice location, but they're failing on the details.More"
27-Sep-20,10,Welp,"Welp, service was bad some false advertisement with drinks e.g they advertise a canned drink and gave me a 200ml glass bottle I paid ¬£3 for a caprisun sized drink üò≠üòÇ they got our orders wrong 74822 times woooow. ALSO I asked for a take...away box the brought me on with no bag so I‚Äôm currently balancing my food on my head.More"

23-Aug-20,20,A good host is needed and check backs should be done.,"I understand that Covid 19 made everyone's life more difficult, but why would you reopen a site if you don't have a plan that keeps everyone safe and that still provides with a good customer service?
Upon arrival there was a big que that started...from outside and no social distancing was applied not even inside the permises. No greeting or explanation of how everything works was given. Unable to sit at a table before deciding what to eat, we were left to stand in a long que next to the bar. To kill some time we decided to order some drinks, but apparently you should have a Vapiano card to then be able to order, which no one provided us before hand. When we got to the station to order, food looked great, pasta is fresh and everything is cooked infront of you which makes the experience nice. When food was ready we sat down at a table and cutlery was nowhere to been seen, so again had to get up to ask for cutlery that was kept at the bar. Food was good and price was reasonable but the customer service side of the experience really put me off and didn't make me fully enjoy my food. It's a beautiful location and I would love to come back, I hope that with this feedback this company will  improve the organisation and managers will be more present to assure all customers leave happily.More"

16-Feb-20,40,Good food but poor execution,"Had a good meal here. Food was tasty and portions were good for the price. The ordering process was unorganized and inefficient. Seems like they want to eliminate wait staff. If so, maybe have tablets to order at the table and then go pick it...More"
